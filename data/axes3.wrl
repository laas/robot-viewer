# Draws the X, Y and Z coordinate axes, each 10 meters long: X red, Y green
# and Z blue, as cylinders with radius 0.1m.

# This document illstrates using PROTO to make a new SimpleAxis node, which
# is the combination of a cylinder and cone, parameterized by its appearance.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Define a new node called SimpleAxis with one parameter, its appearance.
# A SimpleAxis is basically a cylinder of base radius 0.1 and height 10
# resting on the xz plane pointing upward.  Sitting on top of the cylinder
# is a cone of base radius 0.25 and height 1.
